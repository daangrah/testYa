# Test task. Frontend developer. JavaScript
#

## Description for reviewer
##

**A student is given the task to implement an interface with Fetch API using OOP.
The user should be able to:**

* Enter the required information in the form.
* Based on the data entered, get their own rating.
* Perform this operation multiple times.
* Use a mock search by name to view the ratings of other users.

*The JS code must be commented. Private comments can be made in relevant files. General comments should be made at the end of the script.js file.*

## When checking the project, ask yourself the following questions:
##

* Is the Fetch API implemented correctly? Is the data that's collected and received handled properly?
* Are there any vulnerabilities in the code? If yes, what are they?
* Do the functions implemented work properly? Does it satisfy the task assigned to the student?
* How well-structured and clean is the code: in what way can it be improved, changed, or simplified?
* Is the mock data used correctly? Is everything OK with the names of variables and their position in the code/files?
* What about methods in classes? Is there a way to simplify or rearrange anything?
