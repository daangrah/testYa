# Test task. Frontend developer. HTML/CSS
#

## Description for reviewer
##

**A student is given the task to create a responsive web page about travel using HTML/CSS. The web page designed:**

* Should be displayed properly in the latest versions of GC, FireFox, and Safari.
* Should be displayed properly on mobiles, tablets, and desktop devices with different OS.

*The file structure and code must be commented. All comments should be made in index.html. Leave general comments at the end of index.html.*

## When checking the project, ask yourself the following questions:
##

* Is the code valid? Are the tags used semantically correct?
* Is everything ok with the service tags?
* Do you see ways to optimize and simplify the markup? If yes, what are they?
* Are there any problems with BEM (including the project's file structure)?
* What problems do you see in the CSS? Can you recommend any cases with flex/grid-layout to the student? If yes, provide a link.
* What would you say about the positioning of elements? Is every position selected correctly?
* Is the adaptive web design implemented properly? Are there any serious objections to how the responsive version of the website is implemented? Is everything fine with the intermediate resolutions?
* What general recommendations can you make about the project? Can you give examples of good code or back up your recommendations with links?
